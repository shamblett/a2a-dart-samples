# Content Editor Agent

This sample agent can be used to proof-read and polish content.

It uses the Gemini gemini-2.0-flash model. 
You will need an API keys for Gemini set in the following environment variable :-

GEMINI_API_KEY

To run the agent simply do a 'dart pub get' followed by running
the content_editor.dart file i.e. 'dart run content_editor.dart'

The agent will start on `http://localhost:10003`.

See the comment at the top of the containerfile for instructions on how
to build and run the agent as a podman container.

An example of text to polish - 

'The primary significance of this initiative is to augment the operational 
efficiency of the organization, thereby providing a substantial enhancement 
to overall productivity and fostering an improved professional environment 
for all personnel involved in the  project's execution and ongoing management."

Becomes -

'The primary significance of this initiative is to augment the organization's 
operational efficiency, substantially enhancing overall productivity and 
fostering an improved professional environment for all personnel 
involved in the project's execution and ongoing management.

You can also use it as a poor mans' vibe coder, the text 

'I am trying to extend the slider to the full width of app, but I can’t figure out how. I tried wrapping the slider in an Expanded widget, but it didn’t work. What would you recommend I do?
Here is the screenshot of the app:'

for instance results in the following flutter code being generated -
'To make the slider occupy the full width of your app, use the `LayoutBuilder` widget to get the available width and then set the slider's width accordingly. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (BuildContext context, BoxConstraints constraints) {
    return Slider(
      value: _currentValue,
      min: 0,
      max: 100,
      onChanged: (value) {
        setState(() {
          _currentValue = value;
        });
      },
      style: SliderStyle(
        thumbRadius: 6,
      ),
      width: constraints.maxWidth,
    );
  },
)
```

`LayoutBuilder` provides the `constraints` which give you access to the maximum width available through `constraints.maxWidth`. Setting the `Slider` widget's `width` property to `constraints.maxWidth` will make it occupy the full available width.

Alternatively, if you are using the `Slider` as part of a `Row` or `Column`, wrapping the `Slider` with `Expanded` will work. Just ensure that the `Row` or `Column` itself is allowed to expand. Here's an example:

```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Expanded(
      child: Slider(
        value: _currentValue,
        min: 0,
        max: 100,
        onChanged: (value) {
          setState(() {
            _currentValue = value;
          });
        },
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

If the `Expanded` widget didn't work in your case, make sure that:

1.  The `Slider` is indeed a child of a `Row` or `Column`.
2.  There are no other constraints preventing the `Row` or `Column` from expanding. For example, if the `Row` or `Column` is inside a `SizedBox` with a fixed width, the `Expanded` widget won't be able to expand to the full width.

If neither solution works, please provide more context on the surrounding widgets so I can better assist you.
